We're not considering the phenomenon to which the error is related.  In other words, there's no reason to take multiple samples to establish higher certainty.  If we did the same thing with the case of the poppyseed bagel we would think we had developed more certainty but the error rate wouldn't really change unless you waited a long time for the resample.  And in the case of the impaired driver, waiting some amount of time to resample would reduce accuracy unless the rate of alcohol consumption and metabolization was constant - which is slightly more absurd than an ongoing consumption of poppyseed bagels."
