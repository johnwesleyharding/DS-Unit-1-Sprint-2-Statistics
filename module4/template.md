# Assignment!

Fill out the template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.


# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 1

## You

What do you care about?  I've never been good about finding a passion.  Economics has become more interesting to me recently.


What do you know about?  Low grade dataframe operations in python.  


What decisions do you face?  What to do after Lambda.


## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation


2. Trend related to the news
  Economic transformation, gig economy, death of retail, manufacturing, advent of automation?

3. Who does that?


4. Answering a question people care about


5. Valuable to businesses


6. What's the most popular?


7. Cost/Money rankings


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
What misconceptions do I have about my topic?

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?  I saw some of those Hans Rosling ted talks about a decade ago


Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?  I think that domain is fairly well saturated.


Could you do a new question, for the same topic?  Maybe, something about vocational vs technological workforce.


Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?  I don't know yet.


## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

# Ideas for data storytelling - Idea 2

## You

What do you care about?  Response to climate change: geo-engineering and climate science in relation to it.


What do you know about?  I have a general idea that the climate has been changing.


What decisions do you face?  Planning ahead for what to do if the world becomes overwhlemed by mass migration and food shortages.  Or maybe preventing that scenario.

8. How is sub-newsworthy-science not one of these categories.  Maybe all scientists are already data scientists so there is less demand.


## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?  Probably that climate change can be generally reversed, without thinking about the new problems any mechanism that attempts to do so will create.
